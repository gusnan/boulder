How to make a new or edit an old map.

On Mac you need to run from finder by right-click on the app then open, and
 again choose open on the next screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Choose a .map -file in the open dialog.

* Existing file
Just select one in the directory.
It will be loaded.

* New file
Enter a name of a .map -file that does not exist.
Map will be initialized with border and earth, size will be 64x64 tiles.
The size can be changed by cropping or extending the map as below.

Maps saved in the default directory will load in Boulder after the official levels.
Files must not have the same name or .hiscore files created will overwrite each other.

Parameter Time - the time in seconds for the level to end.
Parameter Diamonds - the number of diamond points that must be collected
 for the exit to open.
Parameter for selected tile - determines properties for some objects.
Parameter edit box - sets a level description displayed in the game.

TODO:

More levels
 * TODO

Improvements
 * Improvements to tileset
 * Sound for amoeba enemy moving

 * Make zoom possible (75%, 100%, 150%, 200%)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known limitations/errors:

* Objects slipping and falling can overlap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some decisions:

 * STL is used as much as possible.
 * As little external dependencies as possible is a good thing.
   Currently the game uses SDL2, STL
 * The project shall compile without setting up anything.
 * Indentation is 1 tab. Tabs are ONLY used before any text of a line,
   spaces are used in other places.
